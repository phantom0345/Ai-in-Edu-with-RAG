        "content": "A ladder 25 ft long is leaning against a vertical wall. The bottom of the ladder is sliding away from the wall at 3 ft/sec. Find the rate at which the top of the ladder is sliding down the wall when the bottom is 7 ft from the wall. Let x be the distance of the bottom from the wall and y be the height of the top. The ladder length gives the relation x^2 + y^2 = 625. Differentiate with respect to time: 2x(dx/dt) + 2y(dy/dt) = 0. Solve for dy/dt: dy/dt = −(x/y)(dx/dt). When x = 7, compute y = √(625 − 49) = 24. Substitute dx/dt = 3 to get dy/dt = −(7/24)(3) = −7/8 ft/sec. Interpretation: the negative sign indicates the top is moving downward, and the magnitude gives the instantaneous speed."
