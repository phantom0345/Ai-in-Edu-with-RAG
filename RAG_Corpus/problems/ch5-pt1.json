First compute the subinterval width: Δx = (2 − 0)/4 = 0.5. The right endpoints are x1 = 0.5, x2 = 1, x3 = 1.5, x4 = 2. Evaluate the function at these points: f(0.5) = 1.25, f(1) = 2, f(1.5) = 3.25, f(2) = 5. Form the Riemann sum: R4 = (1.25 + 2 + 3.25 + 5)(0.5) = 5.625. This is an approximation of the area. To represent the exact area, write the definite integral ∫₀² (x² + 1) dx. The setup reflects the limit of Riemann sums as n → ∞. The numerical approximation 5.625 slightly overestimates the true area because the function is increasing on [0, 2]."

Evaluate the function: f(xi) = 2(1 + 2i/n) − 1 = 1 + 4i/n. Form the sum: ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ (1 + 4i/n)(2/n). Distribute to obtain ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ (2/n + 8i/n²). Separate sums: 2n/n + (8/n²)∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ i.

First identify an antiderivative of the integrand. Integrate term by term: an antiderivative is F(x) = x³ − x². Apply the evaluation theorem by computing F(4) − F(0). We obtain F(4) = 64 − 16 = 48 and F(0) = 0, so the definite integral equals 48. Procedurally, this means the accumulated net change of a quantity whose rate of change is 3x² − 2x over the interval [0, 4] is 48 units. Note that no constant of integration is included because it cancels automatically in definite integrals.
