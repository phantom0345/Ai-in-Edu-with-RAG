        "content": "Consider the region bounded by y = x^2 and y = 2x. First determine the intersection points by solving x^2 = 2x, giving x = 0 and x = 2. On this interval, verify which curve is above by testing a point such as x = 1, where 2x > x^2. Set up the area as a single integral with respect to x: ∫ from 0 to 2 of (upper minus lower). Compute the integrand as 2x − x^2. Integrate term by term to obtain x^2 − x^3/3 evaluated from 0 to 2. Substituting the bounds gives the exact area. To extend this into a slicing-volume problem, imagine the same region forming the base of a solid whose cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis are squares. The side length of each square equals the vertical distance between the curves, 2x − x^2. The cross-sectional area is therefore (2x − x^2)^2. Integrate this area from 0 to 2 to obtain the volume, carefully expanding before integrating."

        "content": "Find the volume of a solid whose base is the region between y = sqrt(x) and y = x^2, with slices perpendicular to the x-axis that are right isosceles triangles. Begin by finding intersection points: solve sqrt(x) = x^2, yielding x = 0 and x = 1. On this interval, verify that sqrt(x) lies above x^2. The vertical distance between curves is sqrt(x) − x^2, which forms the leg of each triangular cross-section. For a right isosceles triangle with leg L, the area is L^2/2. Thus the cross-sectional area function is A(x) = (1/2)(sqrt(x) − x^2)^2. Expand the square before integrating to avoid algebraic errors. Integrate A(x) from 0 to 1 to compute the volume. The key procedural steps are identifying the correct geometric formula for the slice, expressing it entirely in terms of x, and performing careful algebra before integration."

First identify the shell radius as x and the shell height as ln x. Set up the volume integral V = ∫[1,e] 2πx ln x dx. To evaluate, apply integration by parts with u = ln x and dv = x dx. Then du = (1/x) dx and v = x^2/2. Substituting gives V = 2π[(x^2/2)ln x − ∫(x^2/2)(1/x) dx] from 1 to e. Simplify the remaining integral to ∫(x/2) dx and integrate directly. After evaluating the antiderivative at the bounds, carefully note that ln 1 = 0 eliminates the lower-bound logarithmic term. The final result is a finite exact volume expressed in terms of π.
