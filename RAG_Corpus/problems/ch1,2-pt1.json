Cancel the common factor (x − 2) to obtain f(x) = 1/(x + 2), but note that the original restriction x ≠ 2 still applies. The simplified form is valid only for x ≠ ±2. Interpretation: although the graph resembles 1/(x + 2), there is a removable discontinuity at x = 2 due to cancellation, and a vertical asymptote at x = −2."
