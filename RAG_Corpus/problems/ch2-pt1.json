        "content": "Evaluate the limit lim_{x→2} (x^2 − 4)/(x − 2). Begin by checking direct substitution. Substituting x = 2 gives 0/0, an indeterminate form, so the limit laws cannot yet be applied. Factor the numerator: x^2 − 4 = (x − 2)(x + 2). Rewrite the expression as (x − 2)(x + 2)/(x − 2). For all x ≠ 2, the factor (x − 2) cancels, leaving the simpler function x + 2. Since x + 2 is defined at x = 2, the limit of the original function equals the limit of x + 2 as x approaches 2. Apply direct substitution to obtain 2 + 2 = 4. Conclude that the limit exists and equals 4, even though the original function is not defined at x = 2. This procedure relies on replacing the function with an algebraically equivalent one that is valid near, but not necessarily at, the point of interest."

        "content": "Evaluate lim_{x→0} (√(1 + x) − 1)/x. Substituting x = 0 produces 0/0, so further manipulation is required. Multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate √(1 + x) + 1 to eliminate the square root in the numerator. This yields [(1 + x) − 1] / [x(√(1 + x) + 1)]. Simplify the numerator to x, then cancel the common factor x from numerator and denominator, valid for x ≠ 0. The expression becomes 1 / (√(1 + x) + 1). Now the limit laws apply, since the denominator is defined at x = 0. Substitute x = 0 to obtain 1 / (1 + 1) = 1/2. Therefore, the limit exists and equals 1/2. The key procedural idea is transforming the expression into a form where direct substitution is permitted."

        "content": "When a limit yields an indeterminate form such as 0/0, pause before applying limit laws. First ask whether the expression can be simplified algebraically for x near the target value. Factoring polynomials, rationalizing expressions with radicals, or simplifying complex fractions often reveals a new function that agrees with the original except at a single point. Only after this simplification should the limit laws or direct substitution be used."
