These are global comparisons: the function’s value at that point is compared with all other values in the interval. Absolute extrema may occur at interior points or at the endpoints of an interval. Importantly, a function might have one, both, or neither absolute extrema depending on its domain and behavior. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}"
