        "content": "Related rates problems study how two or more quantities that depend on time change together. Instead of focusing on exact values, the goal is to understand how fast one quantity changes when another is changing. The key idea is that if quantities are connected by a formula, their time derivatives must also be connected. Even if time does not explicitly appear in the equation, we imagine all variables as functions of time. This allows us to differentiate with respect to time using the chain rule. Related rates appear naturally in motion, geometry, and physical processes such as filling tanks, moving objects, or changing angles. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}"

Only after differentiating the equation with respect to time should numerical values be substituted. This structured approach prevents algebraic and conceptual errors."
