Intuitively, you should be able to draw the graph through that point without lifting your pencil. Continuity depends on three conditions: the function must be defined at the point, the limit must exist at that point, and the limit must equal the function’s value there. If any one of these fails, the function is not continuous at that point. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}"
