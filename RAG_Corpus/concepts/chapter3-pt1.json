Unlike a secant line, which connects two distinct points, the tangent line touches the curve at exactly one point and captures the instantaneous rate of change. The derivative is defined using a limit, allowing us to zoom in closer and closer until the secant line becomes the tangent line. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}"
