        "content": "Approximating area is the starting point of integration. The idea is to estimate the area under a curve by breaking it into simple shapes whose areas we already know, usually rectangles. By adding the areas of many thin rectangles, we get an estimate of the total area under the curve. As the rectangles become thinner, the approximation improves. This idea mirrors how curved regions can be closely filled using many small straight-edged pieces."
