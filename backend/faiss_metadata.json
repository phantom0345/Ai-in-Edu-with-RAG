Instead of focusing on exact values, the goal is to understand how fast one quantity changes when another is changing. The key idea is that if quantities are connected by a formula, their time derivatives must also be connected. Even if time does not explicitly appear in the equation, we imagine all variables as functions of time. This allows us to differentiate with respect to time using the chain rule. Related rates appear naturally in motion, geometry, and physical processes such as filling tanks, moving objects, or changing angles. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}",

Let x denote the side length of the square base and y the height. Write the volume constraint as x^2 y = 216 and solve for y = 216 / x^2. The surface area includes the base and four sides, so S = x^2 + 4xy. Substitute for y to express surface area as a single-variable function: S(x) = x^2 + 4x(216 / x^2) = x^2 + 864/x. Determine the domain x > 0. Differentiate: S'(x) = 2x − 864/x^2. Set S'(x) = 0 to find critical points, giving 2x = 864/x^2, or x^3 = 432. Thus x = 432^(1/3). Verify this critical point gives a minimum by noting S(x) → ∞ as x → 0^+ and as x → ∞. Compute y using the constraint. Conclude that the minimum surface area occurs when the height is half the base length, a result consistent with symmetry in optimization problems.",

Set up the volume integral V = ∫[1,e] 2πx ln x dx. To evaluate, apply integration by parts with u = ln x and dv = x dx. Then du = (1/x) dx and v = x^2/2. Substituting gives V = 2π[(x^2/2)ln x − ∫(x^2/2)(1/x) dx] from 1 to e. Simplify the remaining integral to ∫(x/2) dx and integrate directly. After evaluating the antiderivative at the bounds, carefully note that ln 1 = 0 eliminates the lower-bound logarithmic term. The final result is a finite exact volume expressed in terms of π.
